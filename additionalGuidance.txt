Additional guidance (improvements):

1. Adding Database support including Hibernate and Spring Data JPA
   (also using DB in memory for unit tests)
2. Exception handling improvements - using Spring @ControllerAdvice
   (removing exception checking logic from the controller level)
3. DTOs(data transfer objects using for requests/responses) and entities(using inside application)
   must be different objects.
   I would add mapper (Mapstruct for example) and map required objects in a service level.
4. Adding Swagger with UI (for documentation generating and creating UI for the REST service)
5. Adding Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring our app
